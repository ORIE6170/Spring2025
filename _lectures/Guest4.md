**Title**: Reimagining the Machine Learning Life Cycle in Education (and Beyond)

**Abstract**: With the rapid proliferation of machine learning technologies in the education sphere, we address an urgent need to investigate whether the development of these machine learning technologies supports holistic education principles and goals. We present findings from a cross-disciplinary interview study of education researchers, investigating whether the stated or implied ``social good'' objectives of ML4Ed research papers are aligned with the ML problem formulation, objectives, and interpretation of results. Our findings shed light on two main gaps that each calls to attention an overlooked step in the ML life cycle: 1) the translation of education goals via ML problem formulation and 2) the translation of predictions to interventions. This talk is based on joint work with Serena Wang, Rediet Abebe and Tolani Britton.

course_name: Engineering Societal Systems
course_description: "This class will explore topics in the intersection of computer science, economics, and operations -- on the application of algorithms, data science/machine learning, and mechanism design to the study of democracy, markets, and societal systems at large.
Methodological tools discussed include both theoretical (mechanism/market design, social choice, pricing, matching, etc) and empirical (large-scale optimization, demand estimation, using governmental data, etc). Application domains could include markets (labor, accommodation, services, rides), governmental (transportation, democracy) and other non-profit settings (education, housing, humanitarian, volunteer coordination, food allocation).

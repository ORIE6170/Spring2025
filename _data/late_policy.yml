policies:
  -  You will be allowed three total late days during the semester.  These late days allow you to turn in homework up to 24 hours late, with no penalty; you may also use all three late days on a single homework assignment (allowing you to turn it in up to 72 hours late), but that will leave you with no late days for other assignments.
  - When submitting an assignment late, please mark at the top how many late days are used for this assignment and how many you have used before, if any.

We aim to create an environment that supports students from a diverse set of backgrounds and a wide range of perspectives. Most generally, please treat everyone with respect regardless of their level of knowledge. Be ready to engage with people who know different things than you do, and [don't act surprised if someone doesn't know something](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules). More specifically, we ask everyone to agree to a set of norms during lectures and office hours.

 - Take space, make space: allow others to join the conversation.
 - Embrace a growth mindset. Mistakes are a valuable learning opportunity.
 - Ask questions!
 - Be willing to give and receive feedback respectfully.
 - Recognize that we come from different disciplines and have different academic experiences. Be ready to explain concepts and terms.

## Zoom Norms
 - Be patient when technical issues inevitably arise.
 - Make space for others to speak, with one person speaking at a time.
 - (Larger groups) Use the “raise hand” button when you want to speak and wait until you are called on. If you have a quick follow-up question, use the @ sign in the chat.
 - Keep your Zoom muted when not speaking.
 - Take screen and/or camera breaks from Zoom as you need.
